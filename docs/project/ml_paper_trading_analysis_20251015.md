- **Frequency**: Every ~45-60 minutes (when new 4h candle closes)

### Direction Analysis
```
UP:   100% (4/4 predictions)
DOWN:   0% (0/4 predictions)
```

**Interpretation**: Model consistently predicted upward price movement during the test period.

### Confidence Distribution

35.8%: 2 predictions (first evaluation)
24.4%: 2 predictions (last evaluation)
```

**Average Confidence**: 30.1%
**Min Confidence**: 24.4%
**Max Confidence**: 35.8%

**Trend**: Confidence decreased from 35.8% ‚Üí 24.4% over 3 hours, indicating model uncertainty increased as market conditions evolved.

## LLM Integration Status

### Expected Behavior (Known Issue)
All 3 LLM providers failed with the documented error:
```
‚úó Failed: chatgpt, claude, gemini
  ‚Üí chatgpt: Unexpected Error: 'OHLCVData' object has no attribute 'tail'
  ‚Üí claude: Unexpected Error: 'OHLCVData' object has no attribute 'tail'
  ‚Üí gemini: Unexpected Error: 'OHLCVData' object has no attribute 'tail'
```

**Result**: LLM always returns NEUTRAL (0.0% confidence)

**Impact**: Expected and documented in [phase4_integration_status_20251015.md](phase4_integration_status_20251015.md)

## Hybrid Signal Analysis

### Signal Output
All 4 evaluations resulted in:
```
HYBRID SIGNAL: WAIT
```

### Agreement Score
- **Min**: 22.8%
- **Avg**: 23.95%
- **Max**: 25.1%

**Threshold**: 70% required (strategy parameter)
**Verdict**: ML and LLM never agreed (LLM always NEUTRAL)

### Signal Strength
```
CONFLICT: 100% (4/4 signals)
```

**Why CONFLICT?**
- ML says: UP (24-35% confidence)
- LLM says: NEUTRAL (0% confidence)
- Result: Opposite/conflicting predictions ‚Üí WAIT signal

---

## Trade Execution

### Trades Executed: 0

**Why no trades?**
All three entry conditions failed:

1. **Combined Confidence**: 30.1% avg < 65% required
   - ML: 24-35% confidence
   - LLM: 0% confidence
   - Combined: Insufficient

2. **Agreement Score**: 23.95% avg < 70% required
   - ML and LLM predictions conflicted
   - Far below threshold

3. **Signal Strength**: CONFLICT instead of STRONG/VERY_STRONG
   - Strategy requires clear consensus
   - CONFLICT means "don't trade"

**Verdict**: ‚úÖ **System working as designed** - correctly refusing to trade under uncertain conditions.

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What Worked Well

1. **ML Model Integration**
   - Ensemble model (LSTM + LightGBM + XGBoost) loaded successfully
   - Made predictions every 4h candle close (expected behavior)
   - No "Insufficient clean data" errors (NaN handling fixed)
   - Predictions completed in <1 second

2. **System Stability**
   - 100% uptime over 3 hours
   - No crashes or exceptions
   - Clean startup and shutdown
   - API server operational

3. **Risk Management**
   - Correctly refused to trade under low confidence
   - Hybrid logic properly detected conflicts
   - No false positives (entering bad trades)

4. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Comprehensive logs captured all events
   - Easy to parse and analyze
   - Clear signal output format

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified

1. **Low ML Confidence (24-35%)**
   - **Is this expected?** Unknown - needs analysis
   - **Possible causes**:
     - Model trained on different market regime
     - Current market conditions (low volatility?)
     - Model needs retraining with more recent data
     - Feature engineering may need adjustment
   - **Action**: Investigate model performance vs. market conditions

2. **LLM Integration Broken**
   - **Error**: `'OHLCVData' object has no attribute 'tail'`
   - **Impact**: LLM always returns NEUTRAL (0% confidence)
   - **Status**: Known issue, documented, not blocking ML-only testing
   - **Action**: Fix in future phase (Phase 4.6 or 5.0)

3. **Decreasing Confidence Trend**
   - Started at 35.8%, ended at 24.4% (32% decrease)
   - **Interpretation**: Model became less certain as market evolved
   - **Question**: Is model adapting to new data or drifting?
   - **Action**: Monitor over longer period (24-48 hours)

### üìä Model Confidence Analysis Needed

**Critical Question**: Is 24-35% confidence normal for this model?

**Context**:
- Model was trained on historical data (unknown date range)
- Test ran during specific market conditions (Oct 15, 2025)
- No baseline to compare against

**Recommended Actions**:
1. **Compare to training confidence**
   - What was average confidence during training?
   - What was confidence on validation set?

2. **Test on historical data**
   - Run model on historical periods
   - Establish confidence baseline

3. **Market condition analysis**
   - Was Oct 15 a low-volatility day?
   - Does confidence correlate with market regime?

4. **Model retraining**
   - Retrain with more recent data (last 3-6 months)
   - Check if confidence improves

```bash
# Run 24-hour test
./scripts/start_ml_paper_trading.sh

# Monitor periodically
./scripts/monitor_ml_paper_trading.sh

# Analyze after 24 hours
grep "ML Prediction" user_data/logs/paper_trading_ml_test.log | \
  sed -E 's/.* ([0-9]+\.[0-9]+)% confidence.*/\1/' | \
  awk '{sum+=$1; count++; min=($1<min||min=="")?$1:min; max=($1>max)?$1:max}
       END {print "Count:", count, "| Avg:", sum/count"% | Min:", min"% | Max:", max"%"}'
```

**Expected Output**:
- 12-18 predictions (24h √∑ 4h timeframe = 6 new candles √ó 2-3 evaluations)

**Steps**:
1. Load training logs
2. Compare training confidence to live confidence
3. Run model on historical test set
4. Calculate confidence calibration
5. Decide if retraining needed
