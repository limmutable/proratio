## What is Algorithmic Trading?

**Algorithmic trading** (or "algo trading") uses computer programs to execute trades automatically based on predefined rules. Instead of manually watching charts and placing orders, traders write code that:

1. **Monitors market data** in real-time (prices, volumes, trends)
2. **Analyzes conditions** using technical indicators and patterns
3. **Makes decisions** about when to buy or sell
4. **Executes trades** automatically through exchange APIs

**Benefits:**
- **Speed**: Computers react in milliseconds vs. human seconds
- **Consistency**: No emotional decisions or fatigue
- **Backtesting**: Test strategies on years of historical data before risking real money
- **24/7 Operation**: Crypto markets never sleep; algorithms don't either

**Proratio's Approach:**
Proratio combines traditional quantitative analysis (math-based indicators) with modern AI language models (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to make trading decisions. Think of it as having three expert analysts working together, plus machine learning models trained on historical patterns.

## Multi-AI Consensus System

### How It Works

Instead of relying on a single AI, Proratio asks **three different AI models** (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to analyze the same market data and provide trading recommendations. Each AI:

1. **Receives market data**: Recent price history, technical indicators, volume patterns
2. **Analyzes context**: Market trends, momentum, support/resistance levels
3. **Provides a signal**: Buy, Sell, or Neutral with confidence percentage
4. **Explains reasoning**: Why this signal makes sense

### Consensus Mechanism

Proratio then combines these three opinions using a **weighted voting system**:

- **High Agreement** (all 3 AIs agree): Strong signal → larger position size
- **Moderate Agreement** (2 out of 3 agree): Medium signal → normal position size
- **Disagreement** (no consensus): Weak signal → skip trade or small position
- **Conflict** (opposite directions): No trade → wait for clarity

**Example:**
```
ChatGPT: BUY (75% confidence) - "Strong uptrend, RSI oversold"
Claude:  BUY (68% confidence) - "Bullish momentum, volume increasing"
Gemini:  NEUTRAL (40% confidence) - "Mixed signals, sideways movement"

→ Result: MODERATE BUY signal (2/3 agree, combined 61% confidence)
→ Action: Enter position at 0.7x normal size (reduced due to Gemini's uncertainty)
```

### Why Multiple AIs?

- **Reduces false signals**: One AI might be wrong, but three rarely are
- **Different perspectives**: Each AI model has different training data and biases
- **Robustness**: If one AI service fails, trading continues with remaining two
- **Quality over quantity**: Fewer trades, but higher confidence

## Machine Learning Strategies

### What is Machine Learning in Trading?

**Machine learning (ML)** trains computer models to recognize patterns in historical data and predict future price movements. Unlike traditional indicators (which use fixed formulas), ML models **learn** what patterns historically led to profitable trades.

### Proratio's ML Approach: Ensemble Learning

Proratio uses **three different types** of ML models working together:

#### 1. LSTM Neural Networks
**What it is**: Deep learning model specialized for time-series data (sequences of prices over time).

**How it works**:
- Analyzes the last 24-50 candles (price bars) as a sequence
- Learns temporal patterns: "When price moves like THIS, it usually moves like THAT next"
- Captures complex non-linear relationships

**Strengths**: Best at capturing long-term trends and momentum patterns

#### 2. LightGBM (Gradient Boosting)
**What it is**: Tree-based model that makes decisions using "if-then" rules.

**How it works**:
- Looks at current indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
- Creates decision rules: "If RSI < 30 AND price < lower_band AND volume > average, then BUY"
- Learns which combinations of conditions work best

**Strengths**: Fast predictions, handles many features, good at finding thresholds

#### 3. XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
**What it is**: Another tree-based model, more robust to outliers.

**How it works**:
- Similar to LightGBM but with different mathematical optimization
- Better at handling unusual market conditions
- More conservative predictions

**Strengths**: Reduces overfitting, generalizes well to new data

### Ensemble Method: Stacking

Instead of choosing one "best" model, Proratio uses **stacking**:

1. **Train all three models** on historical data
2. **Collect their predictions** on validation data
3. **Train a meta-model** (Ridge regression) that learns:
   - When to trust LSTM more (trending markets)
   - When to trust LightGBM more (range-bound markets)
   - How to combine their predictions optimally

**Result**: ~10-20% better predictions than any single model alone.

### Feature Engineering

Proratio calculates **65 technical features** from raw price data:

**Price-based**:
- Returns (% change), log returns, volatility
- Support/resistance levels, pivot points

**Momentum indicators**:
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Stochastic oscillator

**Trend indicators**:
- Moving averages (EMA, SMA)
- ADX (Average Directional Index)
- Ichimoku Cloud

**Volume indicators**:
- OBV (On-Balance Volume)
- Volume moving averages
- Volume rate of change

**Volatility indicators**:
- Bollinger Bands
- ATR (Average True Range)
- Standard deviation

**Temporal features**:
- Hour of day, day of week
- Time since last high/low

These features help ML models understand market context beyond just price.

## Trading Strategies Explained

### 1. AI-Enhanced Strategy (Hybrid ML+LLM)

**Concept**: Combine quantitative ML predictions with qualitative AI analysis.

**How it works**:
1. **ML Ensemble** analyzes historical patterns → predicts price direction (UP/DOWN) with confidence
2. **LLM Consensus** analyzes current market context → provides trading signal (BUY/SELL/NEUTRAL) with reasoning
3. **Agreement Scoring** checks if ML and LLM agree on direction
4. **Signal Strength** classification:
   - **VERY_STRONG**: Perfect agreement (ML 75%+, LLM 75%+, 85%+ agreement) → 1.5x position
   - **STRONG**: Good agreement (ML 65%+, LLM 65%+, 70%+ agreement) → 1.0x position
   - **MODERATE**: ML confident, LLM uncertain → 0.5x position
   - **WEAK**: Low confidence → skip trade
   - **CONFLICT**: Opposite predictions → skip trade

**When to use**: Markets with both clear technical patterns AND narrative context (news, sentiment).

**Expected performance**: 65-70% win rate, Sharpe ratio 2.0-2.5

### 2. Trend Following Strategy

**Concept**: "The trend is your friend" - ride existing momentum.

**How it works**:
- Identifies trend direction using moving averages (20, 50, 200-period EMAs)
- Enters when trend is confirmed (price above all moving averages = uptrend)
- Uses ADX to confirm trend strength (ADX > 25 = strong trend)
- Exits when trend reverses (price crosses below moving averages)

**When to use**: Trending markets (Bitcoin rallies, bear markets).

**Pros**: High win rate during strong trends, simple logic
**Cons**: Whipsawed (false signals) in sideways/choppy markets

### 3. Mean Reversion Strategy

**Concept**: "What goes up must come down" - prices revert to average.

**How it works**:
- Uses RSI and Bollinger Bands to identify overbought/oversold conditions
- **Buy signal**: RSI < 30 (oversold) AND price touches lower Bollinger Band
- **Sell signal**: RSI > 70 (overbought) AND price touches upper Bollinger Band
- Assumes price will bounce back to the middle (mean)

**When to use**: Range-bound, sideways markets.

**Pros**: Catches reversals, good in stable markets
**Cons**: Fails in strong trends (keeps buying a falling knife)

### 4. Grid Trading Strategy

**Concept**: Place buy/sell orders at regular price intervals.

**How it works**:
- Sets up a "grid" of price levels (e.g., every $100 for Bitcoin)
- Places buy orders below current price, sell orders above
- As price oscillates, trades execute automatically
- Profits from price volatility regardless of direction

**Example**:
```
Current price: $45,000
Grid: $44,900, $44,800, $44,700 (buys) | $45,100, $45,200, $45,300 (sells)

Price drops to $44,700 → buy order executes
Price rises to $45,200 → sell order executes (+$500 profit)
```

**When to use**: Choppy, range-bound markets with high volatility.

**Pros**: Profits from volatility, no trend prediction needed
**Cons**: Risk of large loss in strong trends, capital intensive

### 5. FreqAI Strategy (Legacy ML)

**Concept**: Use Freqtrade's built-in machine learning framework.

**How it works**:
- Similar to Proratio's ensemble but uses Freqtrade's FreqAI module
- Trains models on-the-fly during trading
- Supports LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost

**Status**: Legacy strategy, superseded by Hybrid ML+LLM approach.

## Risk Management Framework

Proratio implements **6 layers** of risk controls:

### Layer 1: Position Sizing
- **Max risk per trade**: 2% of portfolio
- **Position size calculation**: Kelly Criterion or AI-weighted
- **Dynamic adjustment**: Larger positions for high-confidence signals

### Layer 2: Stop Loss
- **Fixed stop**: 2-3.5% below entry (depends on strategy)
- **Trailing stop**: Follows price up, locks in profits
- **ATR-based stop**: Adapts to volatility (wider stops in volatile markets)

### Layer 3: Take Profit
- **Target profit**: 5-10% above entry
- **Partial exits**: Take 50% profit at first target, let rest run
- **Risk/reward ratio**: Minimum 2:1 (risk $100 to make $200)

### Layer 4: Portfolio Limits
- **Max open trades**: 2-3 concurrent positions
- **Max drawdown**: 10% → halt trading if portfolio drops 10%
- **Daily loss limit**: 5% → stop trading for the day

### Layer 5: Market Conditions
- **Volatility filter**: Skip trades when volatility > threshold (too risky)
- **Volume filter**: Skip trades when volume < average (low liquidity)
- **Spread filter**: Skip trades when bid-ask spread too wide (poor execution)

### Layer 6: AI Confidence Threshold
- **Minimum confidence**: 65% combined confidence required
- **Agreement score**: 70% agreement required between ML and LLM
- **Conflict resolution**: Always skip trades when ML and LLM disagree

**Emergency Stop**: Manual override to close all positions immediately.

## Backtesting and Validation

### What is Backtesting?

**Backtesting** simulates a trading strategy on historical data to see how it would have performed. It answers: "If I had used this strategy last year, would I have made money?"

### Proratio's Backtesting Approach

#### 1. Walk-Forward Analysis
**Problem**: Strategies trained on all historical data may "overfit" (memorize patterns that don't repeat).

**Solution**: Walk-forward testing
- Train on Jan-Jun data
- Test on Jul-Sep data (unseen)
- Retrain on Jan-Sep data
- Test on Oct-Dec data (unseen)
- Repeat...

**Result**: More realistic performance estimates.

#### 2. Validation Framework
Proratio has a **5-10 minute validation** that replaces 5-7 days of paper trading:

**Steps**:
1. **Pre-flight checks**: Strategy file exists, data available, config valid
2. **Accelerated backtest**: Run on 6 months of 5-minute data (thousands of trades simulated)
3. **Performance validation**: Check win rate ≥45%, max drawdown <25%, Sharpe ≥0.5
4. **Integration tests**: Verify strategy interfaces work correctly
5. **Code quality**: Run linting (Ruff) to catch errors
6. **Report generation**: Create detailed performance report

**Success criteria** (all must pass):
- ✅ Minimum 5 trades executed
- ✅ Win rate ≥ 45%
- ✅ Max drawdown < 25%
- ✅ Sharpe ratio ≥ 0.5
- ✅ Profit factor ≥ 1.0
- ✅ No critical errors

**Why faster than paper trading**:
- Paper trading: Wait 5-7 days for enough trades → slow feedback
- Validation: Simulate 6 months in 2-3 minutes → instant feedback
- Can iterate on strategy 60-120x faster

#### 3. Paper Trading
After validation passes, strategies run in **dry-run mode**:
- Real-time market data
- Simulated trades (no real money)
- Virtual balance ($10,000 USDT)
- Test bot stability, API connections, edge cases

**Duration**: 24-48 hours before live trading.

### Performance Metrics

Proratio tracks these key metrics:

**Profitability**:
- **Total return**: % gain/loss on capital
- **Sharpe ratio**: Risk-adjusted return (>1.5 is good, >2.0 is excellent)
- **Sortino ratio**: Like Sharpe but only penalizes downside volatility
- **Profit factor**: Gross profit ÷ Gross loss (>1.3 is profitable)

**Risk**:
- **Max drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline (want <15%)
- **Win rate**: % of trades that are profitable (want >55%)
- **Risk/reward ratio**: Average win ÷ Average loss (want >2:1)
- **Expectancy**: Average profit per trade

**Consistency**:
- **Consecutive losses**: Max losing streak (want <5)
- **Monthly returns**: Standard deviation of returns
- **Recovery time**: How long to recover from drawdown
