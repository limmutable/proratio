# Feature Specification: Enhanced Testing and Validation Reporting

**Feature Branch**: `001-test-validation-dashboard`
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Enhanced Testing and Validation Reporting: Expand integration test coverage and centralize backtest validation results into a database. Focus on P1 (integration tests) and P2 (centralized storage) only. Dashboard visualization (P3) will be implemented in a future iteration."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Integration Test Coverage for Data Pipeline (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to verify that the entire data flow—from collection through storage to loading—works correctly end-to-end, so I can catch integration issues before they affect trading strategies.

**Why this priority**: Data integrity is foundational. Without reliable data flow, all downstream components (signals, trades, backtests) produce unreliable results. This is the most critical gap identified in the current testing framework.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the integration test suite and verifying that data flows correctly from collectors through storage to loaders, delivering confidence in the data pipeline integrity.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a clean test environment with no existing data, **When** the data collection process runs and stores data, **Then** the stored data can be successfully retrieved through the loading mechanism with no data loss or corruption
2. **Given** data exists in storage, **When** multiple concurrent read operations occur, **Then** all reads return consistent and correct data without conflicts
3. **Given** an error occurs during data collection, **When** the error is handled by the pipeline, **Then** the system logs the error appropriately and continues processing valid data

### User Story 2 - Integration Test Coverage for Signal-to-Trade Workflow (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I need to verify that signals generated by the signal system correctly trigger and manage trades through the trade hub, so I can ensure the entire trading workflow operates as expected.

**Why this priority**: The signal-to-trade workflow is the core business logic of the trading system. Failures here directly impact trading performance and profitability. Equal priority with data pipeline as both are critical paths.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating a test signal and verifying it creates, manages, and closes a trade correctly through the entire lifecycle, delivering confidence in the trading workflow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid trading signal is generated, **When** the signal is processed by the trade hub, **Then** a trade is created with correct parameters matching the signal
2. **Given** an active trade exists, **When** market conditions change and trigger trade management rules, **Then** the trade is updated appropriately (stop loss, take profit, position sizing)
3. **Given** a trade reaches its exit condition, **When** the exit signal is processed, **Then** the trade is closed and results are recorded correctly

### User Story 3 - Centralized Validation Results Storage (Priority: P2)

As a trading strategy developer, I need all backtest validation results stored in a centralized database, so I can track strategy performance over time and compare different parameter configurations.

**Why this priority**: Enables historical analysis and performance tracking, which is important for strategy optimization but not as critical as ensuring the core system works correctly (P1 items).

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a backtest validation, verifying the results are stored in the database, and querying the database to retrieve the stored metrics, delivering persistent performance tracking capability.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a backtest completes successfully, **When** the validation script runs, **Then** all key performance metrics are stored in the database with correct strategy name and timestamp
2. **Given** multiple backtests run for the same strategy with different parameters, **When** results are stored, **Then** each run is stored as a separate record with distinguishable metadata
3. **Given** a backtest fails or produces invalid results, **When** the validation script encounters the error, **Then** the error is logged and no incomplete record is stored in the database

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a backtest validation script runs but cannot connect to the database?
- How does the system handle validation results when the git commit hash cannot be determined?
- How does the integration test suite handle partial system availability (e.g., database is up but message queue is down)?
- What happens when validation metrics contain extreme outliers or invalid values (NaN, infinity)?
- What happens if two backtest validations for the same strategy complete at the exact same timestamp?
- How does the system handle database connection failures during test execution?
- What happens when integration tests are run in parallel and they access shared resources?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an integration test suite that verifies the complete data flow from collection through storage to loading
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide an integration test suite that verifies the signal-to-trade workflow from signal generation through trade management to trade closure
- **FR-003**: Integration tests MUST be independently executable and not require manual setup beyond standard test environment configuration
- **FR-004**: System MUST store backtest validation results in a persistent database with the following metrics: strategy name, timestamp, total trades, win rate, total profit percentage, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio, and profit factor
- **FR-005**: System MUST capture the git commit hash for each validation run to enable traceability between code versions and performance results
- **FR-006**: Validation result storage MUST complete within a reasonable time that does not significantly slow down the validation script (target: under 1 second for the database write operation)
- **FR-007**: Integration tests MUST provide clear, actionable failure messages when a test fails, indicating which component or interaction failed
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce data integrity constraints in the database schema to prevent invalid metric values from being stored
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a mechanism to query stored validation results programmatically for future analysis and visualization

### Key Entities

- **Validation Result**: Represents a single backtest validation run, containing performance metrics (win rate, profit, drawdown, Sharpe ratio, profit factor), metadata (strategy name, timestamp, git commit), and identifying information (unique ID). Related to Strategy entity through strategy name.
- **Strategy**: Represents a trading strategy being validated, identified by name. Has one-to-many relationship with Validation Results (one strategy can have many validation runs over time).
- **Performance Metric**: Represents a specific measurable aspect of strategy performance (win rate, profit percentage, drawdown, etc.). Multiple metrics are captured for each Validation Result.
- **Integration Test Suite**: Represents a collection of integration tests organized by functional area (data pipeline, signal-to-trade workflow). Each test verifies end-to-end functionality of a specific system interaction.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can run the complete integration test suite and receive clear pass/fail results for all critical system interactions within 5 minutes
- **SC-002**: 100% of backtest validation runs successfully store their results in the database without failures or data loss
- **SC-003**: Integration test failures are detected and reported with sufficient detail that developers can identify the failing component within the first review (no need for additional debugging runs to locate the issue)
- **SC-004**: The time required to run a backtest validation increases by no more than 5% after adding database storage (minimal performance impact)
- **SC-005**: Stored validation results can be queried and retrieved within 2 seconds for any strategy across any time range
- **SC-006**: Integration tests catch at least 90% of integration issues that would otherwise only be discovered in production or manual testing

## Assumptions & Dependencies *(optional)*

### Assumptions

- The existing backtest validation script produces structured output that can be parsed to extract performance metrics
- Database connection configuration is available through existing Pydantic Settings infrastructure
- The current testing framework supports adding integration tests without requiring major structural changes
- Performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, profit factor, win rate, etc.) are already calculated by the backtest validation process
- Git is available in the environment where backtest validations run (for capturing commit hash)
- The volume of validation results will not exceed database capacity within the foreseeable project timeline

### Dependencies

- Database system must be available and accessible from the validation script execution environment
- Git repository must be initialized and commits must be made for the git commit hash capture to work
- Existing backtest validation script must be modifiable to add database writing functionality
- Test framework must support integration tests (ability to spin up test instances of real components rather than only mocks)

### Out of Scope

- **Dashboard and visualization features** (deferred to future iteration - P3)
  - Visual dashboard for viewing historical performance trends
  - Time-series charts and interactive data visualizations
  - Summary tables and performance comparisons
  - User interface for browsing validation results
- Real-time or live trading monitoring
- Automated alerting when strategy performance degrades below thresholds
- Exporting validation results to external formats (CSV, PDF, etc.)
- User authentication or access control
- Integration tests for components outside of data pipeline and signal-to-trade workflow
- Performance optimization of database queries (basic queries only)
