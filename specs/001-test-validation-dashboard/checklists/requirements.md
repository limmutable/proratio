# Specification Quality Checklist: Enhanced Testing and Validation Reporting

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-27
**Updated**: 2025-10-27 (Scope reduced to P1 and P2 only)
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification focuses on what users need (developers, strategy developers) and why they need it, without prescribing implementation details. Written in business/user-focused language.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are testable and measurable. Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable. Edge cases identified. Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section.

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - User stories are prioritized (P1 and P2 only), independently testable, and have clear acceptance scenarios. Success criteria are measurable and user-focused.

## Scope Changes

**Update 2025-10-27**: Removed P3 (Dashboard/Visualization) from this iteration based on user feedback. This branch will focus on:
- **P1**: Integration test coverage (data pipeline and signal-to-trade workflow)
- **P2**: Centralized validation results storage in database

**Deferred to future iteration**:
- **P3**: Visual dashboard and performance visualization features

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete and ready to proceed to the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**Strengths:**
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1, P2) with independent testability
- Comprehensive edge cases identified for integration testing and database storage
- Technology-agnostic success criteria
- Well-defined assumptions and dependencies
- Clear scope boundaries with "Out of Scope" section explicitly listing deferred P3 features

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` (no clarifications needed)
