# Implementation Plan: Enhanced Testing and Validation Reporting

**Branch**: `001-test-validation-dashboard` | **Date**: 2025-10-27 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-test-validation-dashboard/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This feature enhances the project's testing framework by adding comprehensive integration tests for critical system workflows and centralizing backtest validation results into a persistent database. The primary goals are:

1. **P1 - Integration Testing**: Create integration test suites that verify end-to-end functionality of the data pipeline (collectors → storage → loaders) and signal-to-trade workflow (signal generation → trade creation → trade management)
2. **P2 - Centralized Validation Storage**: Modify the backtest validation script to store performance metrics in a database with proper schema, enabling historical tracking and future analysis

**Technical Approach**: Leverage existing pytest infrastructure to add a new `tests/test_integration/` directory with integration tests that use real component instances (not mocks). Extend the validation script (`scripts/validate_backtest_results.py`) to write metrics to PostgreSQL/SQLite database using SQLAlchemy ORM with schema enforcement.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.14 (project uses Python 3.14.0)
**Primary Dependencies**: pytest (testing), SQLAlchemy 2.0.43 (database ORM), psycopg2-binary 2.9.10 (PostgreSQL driver), pandas 2.3.3 (data manipulation)
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (primary database, connection config via Pydantic Settings in `proratio_utilities/config/`)
**Testing**: pytest (already in use for existing unit tests in `tests/` directory)
**Target Platform**: macOS/Linux development environment, CI/CD pipeline execution
**Project Type**: Multi-module Python project with modular architecture (proratio_utilities, proratio_signals, proratio_quantlab, proratio_tradehub)
**Performance Goals**: Integration test suite completes in <5 minutes, database write operations complete in <1 second per validation run
**Constraints**: Minimal performance impact on validation script (<5% overhead), tests must be independently executable without manual setup
**Scale/Scope**: ~10-15 integration tests covering 2 critical workflows, database stores metrics for all strategies over unlimited time horizon

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### ✅ I. Modular Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Status**: PASS

- Integration tests will be organized by module boundary: `tests/test_integration/test_data_pipeline.py` (proratio_utilities) and `tests/test_integration/test_signal_to_trade.py` (proratio_signals → proratio_tradehub)

**Structure Decision**:

This is a **multi-module Python project** following the existing modular architecture. New code integrates into existing modules:

- **Integration tests** added to new `tests/test_integration/` directory (parallel to existing test directories)
- **Database schema and repository** added to `proratio_utilities/data/` (utilities module owns data infrastructure per constitution)
- **Validation script** modified in-place at `scripts/validate_backtest_results.py`

The structure maintains constitutional module boundaries:
- **proratio_utilities**: Data infrastructure (storage, schema, DB access)
- **proratio_signals**: Signal generation (tested by integration tests)
- **proratio_tradehub**: Trade management (tested by integration tests)
- **tests**: All testing code (unit + integration)

## Complexity Tracking

**No violations to justify** - all constitutional gates pass.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

### Research Tasks

Based on Technical Context and constitution review, the following areas need research:

1. **Integration Testing Best Practices for Python Multi-Module Projects**
   - **Question**: How to structure integration tests that span multiple modules (proratio_signals → proratio_tradehub) while maintaining module independence?
   - **Research needed**: pytest fixture patterns for integration tests, test isolation strategies, shared test infrastructure

2. **Database Schema Design for Time-Series Performance Metrics**
   - **Question**: What is the optimal database schema for storing validation results with efficient querying by strategy name, time range, and git commit?
   - **Research needed**: Indexing strategies, table design patterns for time-series data, PostgreSQL-specific optimizations

3. **SQLAlchemy ORM vs Raw SQL for Simple Insert/Query Operations**
   - **Question**: Should we use SQLAlchemy ORM (already a dependency) or raw SQL for validation result storage given the simple schema and performance constraints (<1 second writes)?
   - **Research needed**: Performance comparison, maintenance considerations, type safety benefits

4. **Test Data Management for Integration Tests**
   - **Question**: How should integration tests manage test data (fixtures, factories, cleanup) for data pipeline and signal workflows without polluting production data?
   - **Research needed**: pytest fixture scopes, database transaction rollback strategies, test data isolation patterns

5. **Security Considerations for Storing Strategy Validation Results**
   - **Question**: Are there sensitive data concerns when storing strategy names, parameters, or performance metrics in the database? (Related to Constitution Security Requirements)
   - **Research needed**: Data classification, access control requirements, encryption needs

### Phase 0 Deliverable

**Output**: `research.md` containing:
- Decisions made for each research question
- Rationale for chosen approaches
- Alternatives considered and rejected
- References to documentation/best practices

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites**: `research.md` complete with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Data Model Design

**Extract from spec entities**:
- Validation Result (FR-004: strategy name, timestamp, total trades, win rate, total profit %, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, profit factor, git commit hash)
- Strategy (identified by name, 1-to-many relationship with Validation Results)
- Performance Metric (specific measurable aspects captured in Validation Result)

**Output**: `data-model.md` with:
- Entity definitions with fields and types
- Validation rules (e.g., win_rate between 0-100, timestamps not in future)
- State transitions (if applicable - likely N/A for this feature)
- Relationships and cardinality

### Contract Generation

**From functional requirements**:

- **FR-004**: Database schema contract for validation_results table
- **FR-009**: Programmatic query interface for retrieving stored results

**Output**: `contracts/validation_result_schema.sql` with:
- CREATE TABLE statement for validation_results
- Indexes for efficient querying (strategy_name, timestamp, git_commit_hash)
- Constraints (NOT NULL, CHECK constraints for valid ranges)
- Comments documenting field purposes

**Output**: `contracts/validation_repository_interface.py` (if using ORM) with:
- Type-annotated interface for insert_validation_result()
- Type-annotated interface for query_validation_results()
- Expected exceptions and error handling contracts

### Quickstart Guide

**Output**: `quickstart.md` with:
- How to run the new integration test suite
- How to set up the database for validation results
- How to query stored validation results programmatically
- Example commands and expected outputs

### Agent Context Update

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` to:
- Add integration testing patterns to agent memory
- Document new database schema location
- Update module boundary notes

## Phase 2: Task Breakdown

**Note**: Task breakdown is generated by `/speckit.tasks` command (NOT by `/speckit.plan`).

The tasks will be organized by:
1. Integration test infrastructure setup
2. Data pipeline integration tests (P1)
3. Signal-to-trade integration tests (P1)
4. Database schema creation (P2)
5. Validation script modification (P2)
6. Documentation and cleanup

## Implementation Notes

### Integration Test Strategy

Integration tests will:
- Use real component instances (not mocks) to test actual interactions
- Set up isolated test databases/storage to avoid polluting production data
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup (database connections, test strategies, mock market data)
- Clean up resources after each test (database transactions, temporary files)
- Run independently without requiring external services (use in-memory databases where possible)

### Database Access Pattern

Validation script will:
- Use existing Pydantic Settings to get database connection string from `.env`
- Open connection, insert validation result, close connection (single transaction)
- Handle connection failures gracefully (log error, continue with file-based validation)
- Use prepared statements/ORM to prevent SQL injection

### Testing Philosophy Alignment

Per Constitution II (Test-First Development):
- Integration tests are self-testing infrastructure
- Each integration test validates that components work together correctly
- Tests will be written before implementation to define expected behavior
- Green tests indicate integration points are working as designed

### Risk Mitigation

- Database writes are additive only (no updates/deletes) to prevent data loss
- Validation script continues to work if database is unavailable (non-blocking)
- Integration tests use separate test databases to avoid impacting production
- Git commit hash capture handles missing git gracefully (logs warning, stores NULL)

## Next Steps

After this plan is approved:

1. Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate detailed task breakdown in `tasks.md`
2. Begin Phase 0 research to resolve open questions
3. Proceed to Phase 1 design (data model and contracts)
4. Execute Phase 2 implementation following TDD workflow

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

**Must exist before implementation**:
- ✅ pytest installed and configured (already present)
- ✅ SQLAlchemy and psycopg2-binary installed (already in requirements.txt)
- ✅ Pydantic Settings infrastructure (already in proratio_utilities/config/)
- ✅ Existing test infrastructure (conftest.py, fixtures)
- ✅ Validation script exists at scripts/validate_backtest_results.py

**Must be created during implementation**:
- Database schema (validation_results table)
- Integration test directory and fixtures
- Database repository module
- Updated validation script with DB writes

## Success Metrics

Implementation will be considered complete when:

- ✅ SC-001: Integration test suite runs in <5 minutes with clear pass/fail output
- ✅ SC-002: 100% of validation runs successfully store results in database
- ✅ SC-003: Integration test failures clearly identify failing component
- ✅ SC-004: Validation script overhead is <5% after adding database writes
- ✅ SC-005: Querying validation results returns data in <2 seconds
- ✅ SC-006: Integration tests catch 90%+ of integration issues (measured over time)
